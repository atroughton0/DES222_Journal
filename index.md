# 1. Conceptualisation # 

02/10/2024
## 1.1 Task and Journal Statements ##
<ins> Predetermined Goal:</ins> Create a context aware web application to enhance user experience through responsiveness and innovation 

The task prescribed is to design and develop a responsive project. The following journal will display how ideas and concepts evolve from the the predetermined goal and through evalutation of existing projects contribute to the creation of the final design.

## 1.2 Determining Design Purpose ##
As the project is aimed to enhance user experience through a context-aware application it is evident that the Design Council‚Äôs Double Diamond methodology will be used to ensure human centred design factors are addressed throughout the tasks design development.

Design Council. (n.d.). Framework for innovation. https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/framework-for-innovation/

In 2024 there has been a growing movement of digital detox through applications like BeReal with a focus on showing the world unfiltered, switching to 'dumb phones', eliminating distractions, and connecting back to nature. Although it may seem contradictory at first, this concept will be core to the development of this project by prioritising simplicity and disconnection.

#### <em> ‚ÄúTravel far enough, you meet yourself" - David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas (2004) ####

<strong> Rationale </strong> - The goal and expected outcome for this project's application to achieve by the end of the design process would be to support a healthier relationship with technology in everyday life by embracing digital wellbeing, promoting mindfulness, as well as presenting moment awareness through the simplicity of an adaptive journal to store meaningful experiences. 

A concept proposal posted of Padlet was created from this rationale as well as a picture collage to brainstorm the aesthetic and functionality of the application.

## 1.3 Research and Evaluation of Existing Solutions ##

03/10/2024

With the rationale and core concepts defined prior in section 1.2 of this journal, it sets up criteria to evaluate existing solutions to identify strengths and weaknesses through SWAT analysis to contribute to the development of this project. The collage above visualises the brainstorming process powering the projects idea by merging certain features and functionality from various applications such as timeline tracking, and adding interactive media with the goal of creating a digital journal to authenticaly preserve how someone felt about a certain day or journey. The collage incorprating varing solutions offers a mixture of different means of usage, target audiences, and functionality which highlights why the SCAMPER ideology will be effective when utalising these numerous existing applications and other relevant hardware examples.

### Existing Solution 1: Google Timelines ###

05/10/2024

Google Timelines is a feature within the Google Maps mobile app and tracks the day of the user, provides insights into monthly travel patterns and exercise, as well as letting you view and edit travel history. Integration with Google Photos also allows users to view a detailed timeline of a day with reference to photos and notes from that day and location of origin, allowing for a detailed and time based journal entries. Some additional background information is that as a hobbyist photographer and outdoors traveler I had used Google Timelines for a couple of years for the reasons stated earlier in the design purpose and my experience from a user perspective of Google Timelines and some of the other solutions is a major part of why this project is being constructed and this experience will be used to find what features can be used as inspiration and what to avoid in the final proposal through SWOT analysis to ensure that user wants and needs are addressed effectively.

<strong> Strengths ‚úÖ </strong>- Google Maps is a free service only requiring a Google account. Great accuracy for road trips with GPS tracking and easily integrates with other Google services such as Google Photos. Application offers wide range of functionality.

<strong> Weaknesses ‚ùå </strong>- Google recently rolled out an update which ended support for Google Timelines online and now only stores information locally for security concerns. This change eliminated cross functionality across devices and made recorded statistics and travel journeys inacurate. Another weakness here in responce to the tasks design purpose is that this apps features are not dedicated towards the intended audience which this task is aiming for which creates an oppotunity to design an app with this focus.

<strong> Opportunities üß≠ </strong>- Google does offer the API of their mapping services for third party use. A timeline like recording where a day entry for a journal is sorted by hour or in order can create a detailed journal entry and offer interactiveness to the user when expanded on. This project can offer grouped insights as seen in the image above to display a summary of activies recorded in the journal.

<strong> Threats ‚ö†Ô∏è </strong>- An inherent threat which would be consistant amoung all these solutions is recording of sensitive data regarding the users location and daily activities which must be protected when sent and stored. An option for local storage only could be provided to users.
