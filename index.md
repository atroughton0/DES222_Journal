In 2024 there has been a growing movement of digital detox through applications like BeReal with a focus on showing the world unfiltered, switching to 'dumb phones', eliminating distractions, and connecting back to nature. Although it may seem contradictory at first, this concept will be core to the development of this project by prioritising simplicity and disconnection.
